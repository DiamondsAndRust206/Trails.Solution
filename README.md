## Setup/Installation

* First, make sure you have MySql Workbench downloaded and properly installed. You will also need a text editor(Vscode was used to make this application)
* At https://github.com/DiamondsAndRust206/LocalBusiness.Solution.git copy the git repository URL from the green "code" button.
* Open a shell program & navigate to your desktop
* Clone the repository using the copied URL and the "git clone" command
* Make sure sensitive data/files are in the .gitignore file so they to no get pushed to a remote repository. The files in .gitignore should be:

```
  */obj/
  */bin/
  */appsettings.json
```

* In the shell program, navigate to the root directory of the newly created file called "LocalBusiness.Solution"
* In the LocalBusinessApi directory create a file named "appsettings.json"
* Add the following code to the newly created .json file
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=local_business;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```
* Make sure the following packages are restored or type the following in the Project directory.
  * `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
  * `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
  * `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
  * `dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
* Then do the following accordingly in your terminal to update and connect your project to your local database :
  * `dotnet restore`
  * `dotnet build`
  * `dotnet ef migrations add Initial`
  * `dotnet run`

* The above code will create a new database in your local host with tables designed to store information related to the project.
* To interact with the local host website navigate to the project directory and run `dotnet run`or `dotnet watch run` then type http://localhost:5000 into the URL bar in the browser.
